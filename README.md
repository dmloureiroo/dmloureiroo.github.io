## ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ Forking this repo (please read!)

I did not design or build this website, I merely modified it. Last I checked, [Bedimcode](https://github.com/bedimcode/) allows people to use this code, but it would be better to hear it from Bedimcode himself, at his website's [GitHub page](https://github.com/bedimcode/responsive-portfolio-complete).
